# Architecture Overview

AstroDASH 2.0 follows a clean, layered architecture for maintainability and testability. All code is open sourced and available at https://github.com/jesusCaraball0/astrodash-web

## High-level layers

1. API Layer (FastAPI)
   - Routers under `app/api/v1/` expose versioned endpoints
   - Validation via Pydantic schemas; global exception handlers and middleware

2. Domain Services
   - Business logic for spectrum processing, classification, redshift, models, batches, templates, line lists
   - Reside in `app/domain/services/`

3. Repositories and Storage
   - Abstractions for spectrum and model persistence and retrieval
   - File-based storage, SQLAlchemy repositories, and OSC API client
   - Reside in `app/domain/repositories/` and `app/infrastructure/*`

4. ML Infrastructure
   - Classifiers (Dash, Transformer, User) and preprocessing utilities
   - Template handling, RLAP computation, and data processing
   - Reside in `app/infrastructure/ml/*`

5. Core & Config
   - Exception handling, middlewar, logging, settings
   - Reside in `app/core/*` and `app/config/*`

## Request flow (example: POST /api/v1/process)

1. API router parses form data (`file`, `params`) and injects dependencies
2. `SpectrumService` obtains spectrum data (file or OSC)
3. `SpectrumProcessingService` applies filtering, smoothing, normalization, metadata
4. `ClassificationService` selects appropriate classifier (Dash/Transformer/User) via `ModelFactory`
5. ML classifier runs inference
6. Response is serialized with sanitized numeric types

## Dependency injection

The `app/core/dependencies.py` module wires services, repositories, and config through FastAPI `Depends` for testability and configuration.

## Error handling

All exceptions are mapped to structured JSON errors in `app/core/exceptions.py`, with precise HTTP status codes and sanitized messages.
